Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a stock market prediction project implemented using multiple machine learning models and deployed using different web frameworks.

The project focuses on analyzing stock market data and building predictive models to estimate stock behavior and trends. The trained models are integrated into web applications and APIs for easy interaction and testing.

Machine learning models used in this project include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier.

Technologies and tools used include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask, FastAPI, and Gradio.

The repository includes Jupyter notebook files for data analysis and model training, along with application files for Flask, FastAPI, and Gradio that allow users to interact with the models.

To run the project, install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. The Flask application can be started by running python app_flask.py. The FastAPI application can be started using uvicorn app_fastapi:app --reload. The Gradio interface can be launched by running python gradio_app.py.

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. It is suitable for learning purposes and portfolio demonstration.
